With everyone getting existential dread because they didn’t make Forbes’ 30-under-30 list, I’d like to point out there’s nothing that says you can’t make your own. With that in mind, [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/s_cottontail24 "My twitter") if you would like to be considered for my own personal 40-under-40 list. Please include what name you would like to be credited under and a short sentence explaining why you would be a good choice for this list.

## The List

1.  **Stephen Dickinson.** I picked myself because, well, that’s one of the perks of making your own list.
